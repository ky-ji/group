Welcome to the **Efficient Deep Learning and Embodiment Group** at [MMLab]().

Our group focuses on developing efficient deep learning methods and their applications in embodied AI systems. We aim to bridge the gap between powerful deep learning models and real-world deployment on resource-constrained platforms, including robots and edge devices.

Our research spans the following core areas:
- **Efficient Embodied AI**: efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, efficient action diffusion models, efficient embodied world models
- **Efficient Deep Learning**: model compression, model pruning, sparse inference, neural architecture search, efficient training strategies

We are actively looking for self-motivated students and researchers to join our team. If you are interested, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:wangzhi@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn).
